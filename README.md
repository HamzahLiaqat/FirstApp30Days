# Practicise

Welcome to my journey of building my very first Flutter app in just 30 days! 🚀 This project is all about learning, experimenting, and enhancing my Flutter skills, step by step. I'll be diving into UI design, state management, and integrating features to create a fully functional app from scratch.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
